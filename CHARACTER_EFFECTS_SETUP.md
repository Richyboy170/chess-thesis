# Character-Specific Piece Effects - Setup Complete

## Overview

The piece effects system has been successfully refactored to support **character-specific configurations**. Each character (1, 2, 3) now has:
- Its own piece effects configuration file
- Its own held images folder
- Customizable effects and parameters

## What Changed

### 1. New Base Configuration Class
**File**: `scripts/piece_effects_config.gd`
- Defines the structure for character-specific configs
- Contains all effect toggles and parameters
- Includes preset methods for quick configuration

### 2. Character-Specific Config Files
Each character now has its own configuration:

**Character 1**: `assets/characters/character_1/piece_effects_config.gd`
- Theme: Classic/Golden
- Default effects: Scale, Glow (golden), Shadow Blur
- Style: Elegant and professional

**Character 2**: `assets/characters/character_2/piece_effects_config.gd`
- Theme: Mystical/Blue
- Default effects: Scale, Glow (blue), Pulse, Rotation, Color Shift, Shadow Blur
- Style: Dynamic and mystical

**Character 3**: `assets/characters/character_3/piece_effects_config.gd`
- Theme: Magical/Fantasy
- Default effects: Scale, Glow (pink), Shimmer, Particles, Sparkles, Aura, Shadow Blur
- Style: Magical with particles and sparkles

### 3. Held Image Folders
Each character has its own held images folder:
- `assets/characters/character_1/pieces/held/`
- `assets/characters/character_2/pieces/held/`
- `assets/characters/character_3/pieces/held/`

Each folder includes a README.md with instructions for adding custom held images.

### 4. Updated Main Effects System
**File**: `scripts/piece_effects.gd`
- Now loads character-specific configurations on startup
- Automatically applies the correct effects based on the character
- Falls back to default config if character config is not found

### 5. Updated Documentation
**File**: `PIECE_EFFECTS_README.md`
- Updated to reflect character-specific configuration
- Added examples for customizing each character
- Includes information about held image folders per character

## How to Customize

### Adjusting Effects for a Character

1. Open the character's config file:
   - `assets/characters/character_X/piece_effects_config.gd`

2. Edit the effect toggles in `_init()`:
   ```gdscript
   func _init():
       # Enable/disable effects
       glow_enabled = true        # Turn on/off
       pulse_enabled = false      # Turn on/off

       # Customize parameters
       glow_color = Color(1.0, 0.9, 0.3, 0.8)  # Golden
       scale_factor = 1.3  # 30% larger
   }
   ```

3. Save the file - changes will apply on next game start

### Adding Held Images for a Character

1. Create your custom image (PNG, JPEG, or OGV)

2. Place it in the character's held folder:
   - `assets/characters/character_X/pieces/held/white_king.png`
   - `assets/characters/character_X/pieces/held/white_queen.png`
   - etc.

3. The system will automatically use them for that character

### Using Custom Image Paths

If you want to use images from a different location:

1. Open the character's config file

2. Set custom paths in `_init()`:
   ```gdscript
   func _init():
       # ...
       custom_held_image_king = "res://path/to/custom/king.png"
       custom_held_image_queen = "res://path/to/custom/queen.ogv"
   }
   ```

## Testing

The implementation is ready to test:

1. **Start the game**: The system will automatically load all character configs
2. **Select a character**: Character 1, 2, or 3
3. **Pick up a piece**: The character-specific effects will apply
4. **Verify effects**: Each character should show their unique effects

Expected console output on startup:
```
Loaded piece effects config for Character 1
Loaded piece effects config for Character 2
Loaded piece effects config for Character 3
```

When picking up a piece:
```
Swapped to held image for Character X: [path]
```
(Or "No held image found..." if no held image is present - this is normal)

## Benefits

1. **Character Individuality**: Each character can have unique visual effects
2. **Easy Customization**: Edit one config file per character
3. **Organized Structure**: Held images are separate for each character
4. **Backward Compatible**: Falls back to default config if needed
5. **No Code Changes Required**: Adjust effects without touching the main code

## Next Steps

1. ✅ System is ready to use
2. ⏭️ Add custom held images to character folders (optional)
3. ⏭️ Customize effect parameters per character (optional)
4. ⏭️ Test in-game with all three characters

## API Reference

### For Game Code

The API hasn't changed - still use:
```gdscript
# Apply effects (automatically uses character-specific config)
PieceEffects.apply_drag_effects(piece_node, piece_data)

# Remove effects
PieceEffects.remove_drag_effects(piece_node)

# piece_data should include:
# {
#     "type": "king",           # Piece type
#     "color": "white",         # Piece color
#     "character_id": 1         # Character ID (1, 2, or 3)
# }
```

### For Config Customization

Each character config has these methods:
```gdscript
# Apply preset configurations
config.apply_preset_minimal()
config.apply_preset_moderate()
config.apply_preset_maximum()
config.apply_preset_elegant()
config.apply_preset_magical()

# Get config as dictionary
var config_dict = config.get_config_dict()

# Get held image path for a piece
var path = config.get_held_image_path("king")
```
