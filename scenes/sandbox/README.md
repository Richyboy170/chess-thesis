# Live2D Model Test Sandbox

A simple sandbox environment for testing Live2D models with the GDCubism plugin, without any game logic.

## Purpose

This sandbox allows you to:
- Verify that the GDCubism plugin is working correctly
- Test Live2D model loading and display
- Switch between different characters
- Test animations without running the full game

## How to Use

1. Open the project in Godot 4.x
2. Navigate to `scenes/sandbox/model_test.tscn`
3. Run the scene (F6 or click the "Run Current Scene" button)

## Features

### Character Selection
- **Scyka (3)** - Character 3 model
- **Hiyori (4)** - Character 4 model
- **Mark (5)** - Character 5 model

Click any character button to load and display that model.

### Animation Testing
- **Idle** - Play the default idle animation
- **Piece Captured** - Play the piece captured reaction
- **Check** - Play the check reaction

### Status Display
The sandbox shows:
- Current character name and ID
- Loading status (success/error messages)
- Console output with detailed debug information

## Troubleshooting

### "GDCubism plugin not loaded" Error
- Make sure the GDCubism plugin is properly installed in the `addons/` folder
- Check that the plugin is enabled in Project Settings â†’ Plugins

### "Model file not found" Error
- Verify that the character models exist in `assets/characters/character_X/`
- Check that the `.model3.json` files are present

### Model Loads but Doesn't Display
- Check the console output for errors
- Verify that the model files and textures are intact
- Try increasing the ModelContainer size in the scene
