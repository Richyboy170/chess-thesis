# Landing Page Backgrounds

This folder contains background assets specifically for the login/landing page.

## Supported Formats

### Static Images
- PNG (.png)
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)

### Dynamic/Animated Backgrounds
- WebM (.webm) - Recommended for animated backgrounds
- Ogg Video (.ogv)

## Guidelines

- Images will be randomly selected and displayed on the landing page
- For best results, use high-resolution images (1080x1920 or higher for mobile portrait)
- Animated backgrounds will loop automatically
- Backgrounds are stretched to cover the entire screen while maintaining aspect ratio

## Adding New Backgrounds

1. Place your image or video files directly in this folder
2. Ensure filenames don't start with "." (hidden files are ignored)
3. The background will be automatically picked up on the next page load
