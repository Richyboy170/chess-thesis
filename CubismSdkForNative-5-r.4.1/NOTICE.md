## [Notes] Building Metal Renderer for Mac Catalyst (2025-05-29)

When building Metal renderer for Mac Catalyst, an issue has been confirmed in which an error ("NSURL not found") occurs with CMake versions 3.27 or higher.  
If you're utilizing this platform, please use CMake version 3.26 or earlier.

## [Caution] Support for CMake 4.0 in Linux OpenGL Environment (2025-05-29)

Regarding support for CMake 4.0, the product currently uses `GLEW 2.2.0`, which does not support CMake 4.0.
Therefore, this sample is not compatible with CMake 4.0. We will update accordingly once GLEW supports it, so please be aware of this in advance.

Please refer to the issue below for details.

## [Caution] Regarding iOS ARM Builds (2025-05-29)

Regarding ARM builds for deployment on physical iOS devices, we have identified an issue causing installation errors on devices due to ios-cmake 4.5.0 used in Cubism SDK for Native.
We are continuing to investigate this issue.

### Workaround

1. Revert ios-cmake to version 4.4.1 or another stable version.

2. In your .xcodeproj settings, select your build target (such as "Demo") under "TARGETS", then in Build Settings > User-Defined, set the following all to YES:
  2.1. CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED and all child settings under this key
  2.2. CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED and all child settings under this key

## [Caution] Support for Wayland in Linux OpenGL Environment (2024-03-26)

`GLFW 3.4`, which this product uses in the Linux OpenGL environment, can now be compiled for Wayland.
However, this sample is not compatible with Wayland because `glewInit` is currently not working properly when compiling for Wayland (EGL) in `GLEW 2.2.0`.

If you are using the Linux OpenGL environment, please continue to use the X11 build as usual.

Please refer to the issue below for details.
